    "\n",
    "Throughout this Jupyter Notebook file, code and comments going through the lesson are already written. You should follow along and run code block by block; this is so that you have a version of the code that won't fail because of simple things like spelling mistakes or missing characters (which happens when you feverishly try to type what's happening up front). Don't worry; there will be opportunities to practice as we move along. If at any point when following along some pre-provided code fails, please don't hesitate to ask one of the instructors for help.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few more notes - unlike R, which we also have workshops in, Python is a general purpose programming language and has less conveniences than R does in terms of data analysis. This means that programming concepts such as loops and if-statements which we've usually not covered in R are far more important in Python. Still, in the interest of time, we're going to prioritize data analysis (specifically working with the `pandas` and `matplotlib` packages) before we move onto these other topics.\n",

    "Given that you are reading this in Jupyter notebook, the cell containing this text is called a Markdown cell; in contrast to a Code cell which will contain, you guessed it, our code. You can create a cell by clicking an existing cell above or below you want a cell, and then clicking on 'Insert' (near the top of this website), and then one of the corresponding options. Most people use Jupyter notebook and these cells to write a kind of interactive report that contains the code to perform the analysis of the report inside it; we'll be using it for some comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also need to know to click 'Run' to run the code in a cell. There are some useful keyboard shortcuts you can also use - Shift-Enter runs a cell, while Alt-Enter creates a new cell (shortcut may differ on Mac)."
